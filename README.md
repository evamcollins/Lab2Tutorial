Hi, my name is Eva, and this repository is used to store and track my work for this project.
In my opinion, GitHub is the most valuable because it makes collaboration and sharing work simple, while Git and GitHub Desktop help keep changes organized and easy to manage.
Overall, these tools make working on projects less stressful and help everything stay in one place.
